# Basic Data Structures 
## Objectives
1. Understand abstract data types stack, queues, and list.
2. Implement the ADTs stack, queue, and deque using Python lists.
3. Understand the performance of the implementations of basic linear data structures.
4. Understand prefix, infix, and postfix expression formats.
5. Use stacks for evaluation of these expression formats.
6. Use queues for basic timing simulations.
7. Ability to recognize problem properties where stacks, queues, and deques are appropriate data structures.
8. Ability to implement the abstract data type list as a linked list using the node and reference pattern.
9. Ability to compare the performance of our linked list implementation with Pythonâ€™s list implementation.
