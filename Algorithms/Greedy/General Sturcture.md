- A greedy algorithm solves problems by making the best choice at each step.
- Instead of looking at all possible solutions, it focuses on the option that seems best right now.
# Problem Structure
- Most of the problems in Greedy follows by two property -
  - Choosing the est possible option at ach step will lead to the best overall solution.
  - Break the problem down into smaller parts, and solving thee smaller parts by making greedy choices.
- One of the most important feature of greedy is - it solves the problems that have an maximising and minimising a quantity
- Most of all Greedy Algorithms can in a way be solved using Dynamic Programming.
- DP proves to be more efficient in terms of approaching and solving the problem than Greedy.
## Some Common Ways to Solve Greedy
- Sorting:
    - Job Sequencing:
        - In order to maximize profits, we prioritize jobs with higher profits.
        - So we sort them in descending order based on profit.
        - For each job, we try to schedule it as late as possible within its deadline to leave earlier slots open for other jobs with closer deadlines.
    - Activity Selection:
    - Disjoint Intervals
    - Fractional KnapSack:
    - Kruskal Algorithm:
- Using Priority Queue or Heaps
- Arbitrary
