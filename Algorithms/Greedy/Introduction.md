# Greedy Algorithms
- Are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step ith the hope of finding a global optimum solution.
- At every step of the algorithm, we make a choice that looks the best at the moment.
- To make the choice, we sometimes sort the array so that we can always get the next optimal choice quickly.
- We sometimes also use a priority queue to get the next optimal item.
- After making a choice, we check for constraints (if there are any) and keep picking until we find the solution.
- Greedy algorithms do not always give the best solution.
- For example, in coin change and 0/1 knapsack problems, we get the best solution using Dynamic Programming.
- Some popular Greedy Algorithms are - **Fractional Knapsack, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Huffman coding, Prim's Algorithm**
- We get an approximately optimal solution.
