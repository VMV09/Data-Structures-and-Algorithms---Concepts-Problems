# The object Oriented Programming in Python.
- Python is a both procedural and object-oriented programming language.
- A powerful feature of any OOPs language is the ability to allow a programmer to create a new class that model data that is needed to solve the problem.
- By building a class that implements an abstract data type, a programmer can take advantage of the abstraction process and at the
same time provide the details necessary to actually use the abstraction in a program.
- Whenever we want to implement an abstract data type, we will do so with a new class.

## A Fraction Class

class Fraction:
  # the methods go here
