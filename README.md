# Data Structures and Algorithm in Python - Concepts & Problems

 Data Structures and Algorithms has been a core and recognized as a vital subject in computing and for computer engineering undergraduates. This Github Reposiroty has been desinged to cater to beginning friendly and slowly metamorphises and cater to advanced levels. <br>

 Rather than simply viweing data as a collection of bytes and addresses, we think of data objects as instances of an abstract data types, which includes a repertoire of methods for performing operations on data objects of this type.

 ## Goals, Principles and Patterns:
 - As the goals of OOPs implies, an Object is an instance of a Class.
 - Each class typically specifies instances variables, also known as data members, that the object contains, as well as the methods, also known as member functions.
 - **Object Oriented Design Goals**
     - Robustness
     - Adaptability
     - Resuability
  - **Object Oriented Design Principles:**
     - Modularity
     - Abstraction
     - Encapsulation
     - Polymorphsim
 - **Design Patterns**
     - The Algorithmic Design Pattern:
        - Recursion
        - Amortization
        - Divide and Conquer
        - Prune and Search - Decrease and Conquer
        - Brute Force
        - Dynamic Programming
        - The Greedy Method
    - Software Engineering Design Patterns:
        - Iterator
        - Adapter
        - Position
        - Composition
        - Template Method
        - Locator
        - Factory Method
